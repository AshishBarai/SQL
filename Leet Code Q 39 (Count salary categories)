Count Salary Categories

Question :-

Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution:-

SELECT 
CASE 
    WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
    WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'
    WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
END AS category,
COUNT(*) AS accounts_count 
FROM Accounts
GROUP BY category;

OR 

SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, SUM(if(income < 20000,1,0)) AS accounts_count 
FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, SUM(if(income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000,1,0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts

UNION 

SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, SUM(if( income > 50000,1,0)) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
