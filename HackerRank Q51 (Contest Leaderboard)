  Question:-
  You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges.
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the 
descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result 
by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Code:-


SELECT t1.hacker_id,t1.name,SUM(gb.score) AS total_score
FROM(
        SELECT hacker_id, MAX(score) AS score
        FROM submissions
        GROUP BY hacker_id,challenge_id ) AS gb
JOIN hackers AS t1 ON t1.hacker_id = gb.hacker_id
GROUP BY t1.hacker_id,t1.name
HAVING total_score != '0'
ORDER BY total_score DESC ,hacker_id ;
