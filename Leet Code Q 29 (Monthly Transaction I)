| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |
| state         | enum    |

id is the primary key of this table.

    country,
    COUNT(amount) AS trans_count,
    SUM(IF(state = 'approved', 1, 0)) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month,country;
