QUESTION:-

Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


CODE:-
SELECT CASE
WHEN (A=B AND B=C) THEN "Equilateral"
WHEN (A+B<=C OR B+C<=A OR C+A<=B) THEN "Not A Triangle"
WHEN (A=B OR B=C OR C=A) THEN "Isosceles"
ELSE "Scalene"
END 
FROM TRIANGLES;
