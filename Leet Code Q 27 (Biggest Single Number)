LeetCode 

Biggest Single Number

Question:-

Table: MyNumbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

Code:-

SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM MyNumbers
WHERE num NOT in (SELECT num
		FROM MyNumbers
		GROUP BY num
		HAVING COUNT(num) > 1
		);
