'My SQL SERVER'
Question:-
Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000 . 
Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand (&) character as your 
separator (instead of a space).

Code:-

DECLARE @R as Integer;
SET @R = 1000;
DECLARE @tbl table(number integer);

WHILE @R >=2 
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO @tbl VALUES(@R);
        SET @R = @R - 1;
    END

SELECT STRING_AGG(number,'&') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY number)
FROM @tbl tbl1
WHERE NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1
FROM @tbl tbl2
WHERE tbl2.number < tbl1.number AND (tbl1.number % tbl2.number) = 0)
