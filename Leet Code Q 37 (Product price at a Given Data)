Product Price at a Given Date

Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

Solution :-

SELECT product_id,10 AS price
FROM Products
Group by product_id
HAVING  MIN(change_date) > '2019-08-16'

UNION

SELECT product_id,new_price AS price
FROM Products
WHERE (product_id, change_date) IN (
    SELECT product_id,MAX(change_date) 
    FROM Products
    WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    GROUP BY product_id
)
