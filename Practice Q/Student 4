Creating a student table:

CREATE TABLE students
(
studentid int NULL,
student_name varchar (255) NULL,
subject varchar (255) NULL,
marks int NULL,
test_id int NULL,
test_date date NULL
);

Explanation:

> CREATE TABLE students: This statement creates a new table named students.
> Inside the parentheses, we define the columns and their data types:
> studentid int NULL: An integer column that can store NULL values, representing 
the student ID.
> student_name varchar(255) NULL: A variable character column with a maximum length 
of 255 characters that can store NULL values, representing the student's name.
> subject varchar(255) NULL: A variable character column with a maximum length of 255 
characters that can store NULL values, representing the subject.
> marks int NULL: An integer column that can store NULL values, representing the marks 
obtained by the student.
> test_id int NULL: An integer column that can store NULL values, representing the test ID.
> test_date date NULL: A date column that can store NULL values, representing the date of 
the test.

Deleting all the data from student table
DELETE FROM students;

Explanation:
> This command deletes all rows from the students table. It does not delete the table itself, 
only the data within it. After this command, the students table will be empty.

Inseting data into student table:
insert into students values (2,'Max Ruin','Subject1',63,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (3,'Arnold','Subject1',95,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (4,'Krish Star','Subject1',61,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (5,'John Mike','Subject1',91,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (4,'Krish Star','Subject2',71,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (3,'Arnold','Subject2',32,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (5,'John Mike','Subject2',61,2,'2022-11-02');
insert into students values (1,'John Deo','Subject2',60,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (2,'Max Ruin','Subject2',84,1,'2022-01-02');
insert into students values (2,'Max Ruin','Subject3',29,3,'2022-01-03');
insert into students values (5,'John Mike','Subject3',98,2,'2022-11-02');

Explanation:
> Each insert into students values (...) command inserts a new row into the students table.
> The values in each row correspond to the columns defined in the students table schema:
> studentid: The ID of the student.
> student_name: The name of the student.
> subject: The subject in which the marks were obtained.
> marks: The marks obtained by the student in the subject.
> test_id: The ID of the test.
> test_date: The date when the test was conducted.
> Inserted Data:

The data includes multiple rows for each student, with different subjects and test dates, representing the marks obtained by the students in various subjects and tests.
For example:
> Student with studentid 2 (Max Ruin) has marks for Subject1, Subject2, and Subject3 on different test dates.
> Student with studentid 5 (John Mike) has marks for Subject1, Subject2, and Subject3, some on the same test date and some on different test dates.

Q : For each student and test, identify if their marks increased or decreased from the 
  previous test.

Solution : 

Select *,
case when marks > prev_marks then "increase" when marks < prev_marks then "decrease" end AS IncDesc
from
(
select *,
lag(marks,1) over(partition by studentid order by test_date, subject) as prev_marks
from students
