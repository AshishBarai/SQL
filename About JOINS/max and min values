Q: There are 2 tables, first table has 5 records and second table has 10 records, you can 
assume any values in each of the tables, how many maximum and minimum records possible in 
each of inner join, left join, right join and full outer join.

Solution:
Suppose we have two tables, t1 and t2, with column names id1 and id2 respectively.

For maximum records, let's assume all entries in t1 and t2 are 1. When we perform 
inner join, left join, right join, and full outer join, the output will be a total 
of 50 records for each join.

example:
select * from t1 
inner join t2 on t1.id = t2.id
&
select * from t1 
left join t2 on t1.id = t2.id
&
select * from t1 
right join t2 on t1.id = t2.id
&
select * from t1 
full outer join t2 on t1.id = t2.id

the output will be total of 50 records for each join.

and 

for minimum records

supose we have two tables t1 and t2 with column name id1 and id2 respectivly
For maximum records let assume we have all the entry as 1,1,1,1,1 in t1 and 
for t2 all the entry as 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 then we we do inner join, left join, 
right join, and full outer join

example:
select * from t1 
inner join t2 on t1.id = t2.id

For inner join, there would be zero records as there are no matching records in both 
tables.

&
select * from t1 
left join t2 on t1.id = t2.id

for left join there would be 5 records because all the records will come from left table 
and no records will come from right table as there are zero matching records

&
select * from t1 
right join t2 on t1.id = t2.id

for right join there would be 10 records because all the records will from from right table
and no records will come from left table as there are zero matching records.

&
select * from t1 
full outer join t2 on t1.id = t2.id

and for full outer join or we can use union as full outer join does not work in some SQL database,
the output would be 15 because all the records from t1 table which is 5 and all the records from 
t2 table will come which is 10.
