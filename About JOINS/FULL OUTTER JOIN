About FULL OUTTER JOIN

Query:

SELECT *,
FROM table1_name AS t1
FULL OUTTER JOIN table2_name AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id

EXPLANATION:

A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either table. 
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the columns that do not have a
match in the other table.
