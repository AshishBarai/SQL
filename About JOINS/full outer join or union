Q : Find the change is employee status

create table emp_2020
(
emp_id int,
designation varchar(20)
);
create table emp_2021
(
emp_id int,
designation varchar(20)
);

insert into emp_2020 values(1,"Trainee"),(2,"developer"),(3,"senior developer"),(4,"manager");
insert into emp_2021 values(1,"developer"),(2,"developer"),(3,"manager"),(5,"trainee");

Using FULL OUTER JOIN:

select e0.*, e1.*,
	case when e0.designation != e1.designation then "pormotion"
    when   e0.designation = e1.designation then "same position"
    when e1.designation is null then "resigned"
    else "new joinee" 
    end as commit
from emp_2020 as e0
full outer join emp_2021 as e1 on e0.emp_id = e1.emp_id
where isnull(e0.designation,'zzz') = isnull(e1.designation,'xxx');

AND IF FULL OUTER JOIN DOES NOT WORK THEN WE CAN USE UNION

using UNION :

SELECT e0.*, e1.*, 
       CASE 
           WHEN e0.designation != e1.designation THEN 'promotion'
           WHEN e0.designation = e1.designation THEN 'same position'
           WHEN e1.designation IS NULL THEN 'resigned'
           ELSE 'new joinee'
       END AS 2022_designation
FROM emp_2020 AS e0
LEFT JOIN emp_2021 AS e1 ON e0.emp_id = e1.emp_id
UNION
SELECT e0.*, e1.*, 
       CASE 
           WHEN e0.designation != e1.designation THEN 'promotion'
           WHEN e0.designation = e1.designation THEN 'same position'
           WHEN e1.designation IS NULL THEN 'resigned'
           ELSE 'new joinee'
       END AS 2022_designation
FROM emp_2020 AS e0
RIGHT JOIN emp_2021 AS e1 ON e0.emp_id = e1.emp_id;
