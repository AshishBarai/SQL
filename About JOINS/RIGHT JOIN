About RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTTER JOIN

Query:

SELECT *,
FROM table1_name AS t1
RIGHT JOIN table2_name AS t2 on t1.id = t2.id;

Explanation:

A right join returns all rows from the right table (table2_name), 
and the matched rows from the left table (table1_name). If no match 
is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
