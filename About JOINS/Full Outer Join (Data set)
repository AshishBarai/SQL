4. Full outer Join

It returns all the records from both the table


select coalesce(so.order_id, r.order_id) as order_id_final, so.order_id, r.order_id, sales
from superstore_order as so
full outer join `return` as r ON so.Order_ID = r.Order_ID;

COALESCE : if so.order_id is null then it will return the values of r.order_id,
          and
           if so.order_id is not null then it will return the values of so.order_id

IF FULL OUTER JOIN DOES NOT SUPPORT THEN :

can use union of left join and right join

select coalesce(so.order_id, r.order_id) as order_id_final, so.order_id, r.order_id, so.sales
from superstore_order as so
left join `return` as r on so.Order_ID = r.Order_ID
union
select coalesce(so.order_id, r.order_id) as order_id_final, so.order_id, r.order_id, so.sales
from superstore_order as so
right join `return` as r on so.Order_ID = r.Order_ID;
