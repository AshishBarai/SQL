About LEFT Join or LEFT OUTTER JOIN

SELECT *,
FROM table1_name as  t1
INNER JOIN table2_name as t2 on t1.id = t2.id

EXPLAINATION:

A left join returns all rows from the left table (table1_name), and the matched rows 
from the right table (table2_name). If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns 
from the right table.
