QEUSTION:-

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(a,b) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a,b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) 
and (c,d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display  decimal digits.


CODE:-

SELECT CAST(SQRT((SQUARE(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N))) 
        + (SQUARE(MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)))) AS DECIMAL (10,4))
FROM STATION
