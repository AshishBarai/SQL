Patient Support Analysis (Part 2) [UnitedHealth SQL Interview Question]

Question:-

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate
and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, 
health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a 
category. These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters 
nothing into the category field).

Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.

Code:-

SELECT ROUND(100.0*
       COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE call_category IS NULL or call_category = 'n/a')/
       COUNT(case_id),1) AS call_persentage
FROM callers;
