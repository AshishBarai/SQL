Q: How to find Duplicate from the given data ?

SELECT col_1, col_2, COUNT(*) AS Count

HAVING Count > 1;

OR

With windows function:

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT *,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY col_1 ORDER BY col_1) AS rn
FROM table_name
)
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE col_1 IN (
                SELECT col_1,
                        FROM CTE
                        WHERE rn > 1
                );
