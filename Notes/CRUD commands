# About CRUD part 1 (Create)

CRUD command

C: CREATE
R: READ
U: UPDATE
D: DELETE

About Create Command
CREATE command is used to add new records or data to a database, specificlly it 
involves adding new rows to a table

-- # CREATE

CREATE TABLE fish
(
	fish_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    breed VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (fish_id)
);

1.fish_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT: This column represents the unique identifier for 
each fish. It is an integer, cannot be null, and will automatically increment with each 
new record.

2.name VARCHAR(100): This column stores the name of the fish, allowing up to 100 
characters.

3.breed VARCHAR(100): This column stores the breed of the fish, also allowing up to 100 
characters.

4.age INT: This column stores the age of the fish as an integer.

5.PRIMARY KEY (fish_id): The fish_id column is designated as the primary key, meaning 
each value in this column must be unique and cannot be null, ensuring each record in the table can be uniquely identified.

To inser the values:
INSERT INTO fish(name, breed, age) 
VALUES
	('ringo','koi',4),
    ('cindy','shark',10),
    ('dumbeldore','shark',11),
    ('egg','pleco',4),
    ('misty','koi',13),
    ('luffy','oscar',9),
    ('jackson','angel',7);

# About CRUD part 2 (READ)

About the READ Command in CRUD
The READ command in CRUD operations is used to retrieve data from 
a database. This operation is typically performed using the SQL SELECT 
statement, which allows you to fetch data based on specific criteria.

Selecting All Columns:
To select all columns from a table:
SELECT * 
FROM fish
The * symbol means it selects all the columns in the fish table.

Selecting Specific Columns:
If you want to select a particular column, you can specify the column name:
SELECT column_name 
FROM fish

For example, to select the name and age columns:
for two columns:
SELECT name, age 
FROM fish

Using the WHERE Clause:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions.

To select all columns where the age is 4:
SELECT * 
FROM fish
WHERE age = 4;

To select all columns where the name is "egg":
SELECT * 
FROM fish
WHERE name = "egg";

The WHERE clause filters the rows according to the given condition. It is also case
insensitive, meaning it does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters 
in string comparisons.

# About CRUD part 3 (UPDATE)

# About the UPDATE Command in CRUD:(Modifiy Existing data)
UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in table. It allows you to change 
the values of one or more rows in a table.

# Key componets of the UPDATE command:
UPDATE: Specifies the table to be updated.
SET: Specifies the columns and the new values
WHERE: Specifies which rows to update, without it all rows will be updated.

Example:
UPDATE fish
SET breed = "octopus"
WHERE breed = "koi";
* UPDATE fish: Specifies the 'fish' table.
* SET breed = 'octopus': changes the 'breed' to 'octopus'
* WHERE breed = 'koi': Only rows where 'breed' is 'koi' will be updated

# About CRUD part 4 (DELETE)

# About the DELETE Command in CRUD:(delete Existing data)
> The DELETE command is used to remove existing data from a table. This operation 
affects the data within the table, not the structure of the table itself.

# Deleting Specific rows
for example if we want to delete To delete specific rows based on a condition, we can 
use the DELETE command with a WHERE clause.
DELETE 
FROM fish
WHERE name = "ringo";
DELETE FROM fish: Specifies the fish table.
WHERE name = "ringo": Deletes rows where the name is "ringo".

# To remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact, you omit 
the WHERE clause.
DELETE 
FROM fish;
This command deletes all the data from the fish table, but the schema (table structure) 
remains intact.
