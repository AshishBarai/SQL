Sending vs. Opening Snaps [Snapchat SQl Interview Question]

Question :-

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their
ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a 
percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

*Calculate the following percentages:
  >time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
  >Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
*To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

Code:-

SELECT
 t2.age_bucket,
    ROUND(100.0*  (SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'send')) / 
      (SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'send')+
      SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'open')),2) AS send_perc,
    ROUND(100.0*  (SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'open')) / 
      (SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'send')+
      SUM(t1.time_spent) FILTER (WHERE activity_type = 'open')),2) AS send_perc
FROM activities AS t1
LEFT JOIN age_breakdown AS t2 
    ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
WHERE t1.activity_type IN ('open','send')
GROUP BY t2.age_bucket;
