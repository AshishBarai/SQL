ACID Properties in SQL

The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

# Isolation
Isolation ensures that the operations of one transaction are isolated from those of other transactions. 
This means the intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions until the transaction is complete. 
Isolation levels can vary, allowing trade-offs between performance and strict isolation.

Example:
If two transactions occur simultaneously—one transferring money from Account A to Account B and another 
transferring from Account B to Account C—each transaction should not interfere with the other. The operations 
in one transaction must appear isolated to the operations in the other, preventing scenarios where both transactions 
see an incomplete state of the other.
