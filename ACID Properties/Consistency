ACID Properties in SQL

The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

# Consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another, maintaining 
database integrity. This means any data written to the database must comply with all predefined rules, 
including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination of database rules.

Example:
Continuing with the bank transfer, consistency ensures that the sum of the balances in both accounts remains 
unchanged by the transaction. If Account A has $500 and Account B has $300 before the transfer, after transferring 
$100 from A to B, the total amount should still be $800.
