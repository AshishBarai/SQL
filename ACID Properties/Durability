ACID Properties in SQL

The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

Durability
Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system 
failure. This means the results of the transaction are permanently recorded in the database. Durability is 
typically achieved through mechanisms like write-ahead logging and checkpoints.

Example:
If the bank transfer is completed and the transaction is committed, the changes (the $100 deducted from Account 
A and added to Account B) must be permanently recorded. Even if a power failure occurs immediately after the transaction 
commits, the changes should not be lost.
