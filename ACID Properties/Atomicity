ACID Properties in SQL

The ACID properties are a set of principles that ensure reliable processing of database transactions.
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

# Atomicity
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work, meaning either all operations
within the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction 
fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving the database in its previous state. This guarantees 
that partial transactions do not occur, preventing data corruption.

Example:
Consider a bank transfer where $100 is moved from Account A to Account B. This transaction involves two 
operations: deducting $100 from Account A and adding $100 to Account B. Atomicity ensures that either both 
operations succeed or both fail. If the deduction from Account A succeeds but the addition to Account B fails,
the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring no money is lost or incorrectly recorded.
