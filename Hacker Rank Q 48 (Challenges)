QUESTION:-

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, 
then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, 
then exclude those students from the result.

CODE:-


select h.hacker_id,h.name,count(ch.hacker_id) as total_hcount 
from hackers h 
join challenges ch on h.hacker_id=ch.hacker_id 
group by h.hacker_id,h.name 
having count(ch.hacker_id) not in(select distinct count(hacker_id) 
                                  from challenges ch where hacker_id<>h.hacker_id 
                                  group by hacker_id having count(hacker_id<(selectmax(x.challenge_count) 
                                                                              
from (select count(ch.challenge_id)as challenge_count 
      from challenges ch group by ch.hacker_id) as x)) 
      order by total_hcount desc,h.hacker_id
