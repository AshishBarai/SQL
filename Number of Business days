Q : Write a SQL to find business days between create date and resolved date by excluding weekends and holidays.
first creating a table to the query: - 

CREATE TABLE tickets
(
ticket_id VARCHAR(20),
create_date DATE,
resolved_date DATE
);
>Creating a new table named as TICKETS

DELETE FROM tickets;
>This statement deletes all existing rows from the 'tickets' table. This is useful for resetting the table before inserting new data.


INSERT INTO tickets VALUES
(1,'2022-08-01','2022-08-03')
,(2,'2022-08-01','2022-08-12')
,(3,'2022-08-01','2022-08-16');
> Inserting Data into the 'tickets' Table


CREATE TABLE holidays
(
holiday_date date,
reason VARCHAR(100)
);
> Create a new table named as HOLIDAYS

DELETE FROM holidays;
>Deleting All Rows from the 'holidays' Table


INSERT INTO holidays VALUES
('2022-08-11','Rakhi'),
('2022-08-15','Independence day');
>Inserting data into the 'tickets' table


SOLUTION:- 

SELECT *,
(datediff(resolved_date, create_date) - (week(resolved_date) - week(create_date)) * 2) - no_of_holidays AS business_days
FROM (select ticket_id, create_date, resolved_date, count(holiday_date) AS no_of_holidays
from tickets
LEFT JOIN holidays on holiday_date between create_date and resolved_date
GROUP BY ticket_id, create_date, resolved_date) A
