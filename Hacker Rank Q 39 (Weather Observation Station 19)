QUESTION:-

Consider P1(a,b) and P2(a,b) to be two points on a 2D plane.

> a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
> b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
> c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
> d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.


code:-

SELECT (CAST((MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) AS DECIMAL (10,4)) 
        + CAST((MAX(LONG_W) - MIN(LONG_W)) AS DECIMAL (10,4)))
FROM STATION;
