Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

Question :-

Table: Employees

+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null). 
 

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

Solution :- 

Select employee_id
From Employees
Where salary < 30000 AND manager_id NOT IN (
    Select employee_id
    From Employees
)
Order By employee_id

OR 

with cte as (
    select employee_id, manager_id 
    From  employees
    Where salary < 30000
)
Select employee_id
From cte
Where manager_id NOT IN (Select employee_id From employees)
Order by employee_id;
