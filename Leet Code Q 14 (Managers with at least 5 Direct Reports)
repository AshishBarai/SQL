LeetCode Q14/50 (Managers with at least 5 Direct Reports)

Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write an SQL query to report the managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

Code:-

SELECT t1.name
FROM employee AS t1
INNER JOIN employee AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.managerid
GROUP BY t1.name
HAVING COUNT(t1.name) >= 5;
