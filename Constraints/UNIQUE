# Unique

This constraint helps to uniquely idnetify each row in the table. i.e. for a particular column, all the rows should have unique values. We can have more than ine UNIQUE columns in a table.

For example, the below query creates a table Student where the filed ID is specified as UNIQUE. i.e. no two students can have the came ID.

CREATE TABLE student
(
ID int(10) NOT NULL UNIQUE
NAME varchar(100) NOT NULL,
address varchar(100)
);
