# Constraints

Constraints are the rules that we can apply on the types of data in a table. That is, we can specify the limit on the type of data that can be stored in a particular column in a table using constraint.

The availabe constraints in SQL are:

> NOT NULL: This constraint tells that we cannot store a null value in a column. That is, if a column is specified as NOT NULL then we will not be able to store null in this particular column any more.

> UNIQUE: This constraint when spoecified with a column, tell that all the values in the column must be uniwue. That is, the values in any row of a colum must not be repeated.

> PRIMARY KEY: A primary key is a field which can uniquely identify each row in a table. And this constraint is used to specify a field in a tables as primary key.

> FOREIGN KEY: A foreign key is a field which can uniquely idnetify each row in a another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as Foreign key.

> CHECK: This constraint helps to validate the values of a column to meet stored in a column condition. That is, it helps to ensure that the values stores in a column meets a specifiic condition.

> DEFAULT: This constraint specifies a default values for the column when no values is specified by the user.
