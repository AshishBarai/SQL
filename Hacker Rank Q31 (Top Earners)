Question:-

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked,
and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.


Code:-

SELECT TOP 1 MAX(SALARY * MONTHS) AS MAX,
COUNT MAX(SALARY * MONTHS)
FROM EMPLOYEE
GROUP BY SALARY
ORDER BY MAX DESC;
