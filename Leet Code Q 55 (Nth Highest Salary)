Table: Employee

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the nth highest salary from the Employee table. 
If there is no nth highest salary, return null.

Solution:-

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
RETURN (
    SELECT DISTINCT(sub.salary)
        FROM (SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r
        FROM employee) AS sub
        WHERE sub.r = N
  );
END
