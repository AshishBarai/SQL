Question:-
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write an SQL query to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

code:-

SELECT query_name,
       ROUND((SUM(rating / position) / COUNT(*)),2) AS quality,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name;
