Second Day Confirmation [Tiktok SQL Interview Question]

Question:-

Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and 
confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, 
and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, 
but confirmed on the second day.

Code:-

SELECT e.user_id
FROM emails e
JOIN texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE t.action_date = e.signup_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
      AND t.signup_action = 'Confirmed';
