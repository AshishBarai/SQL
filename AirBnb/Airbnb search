Q : Find the room types that are searched most number of times.
    Output the room types alongside the number of searched for it.
    If the filter for room types has more than one room type,
      consider each unique room type as a separate row.
    Sort the result based on the number of searches in decending order.

Script : 

create table airbnb_search
(
user_id int,
date_searched date,
filter_room_types varchar (100)
);

delete from airbnb_search;

insert into airbnb_search values
(1,'2022-01-01','entire home,private room'),
(2,'2022-01-02','entire home,shared room'),
(3,'2022-01-02','private room,shared room'),
(4,'2022-01-03','private room')
;

SOLUTION :

with room as 
(
select 
	sum(case when filter_room_types like '%entire%' then 1 else 0 end) as en,
    sum(case when filter_room_types like '%private%' then 1 else 0 end) as pr,
    sum(case when filter_room_types like '%shared%' then 1 else 0 end) as sh
from airbnb_search
)
select 'entire room' as value, en as count from room
union all
select 'private room' as value, pr as count from room
union all 
select 'shared room' as value, sh as count from room
order by count desc;
