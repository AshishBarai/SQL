Question:-

Table: Activity
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of 
games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write an SQL query to report the first login date for each player.


Code:-

SELECT player_id,min(event_date) AS first_date
FROM activity
GROUP BY player_id;
