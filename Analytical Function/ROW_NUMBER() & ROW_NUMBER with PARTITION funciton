SQL Table and Data Insertion
First, we create an employee table and insert some data into it:

CREATE TABLE employee(
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(20),
    dept_id INT,
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'Ankit', 100, 10000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (2, 'Mohit', 100, 15000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (3, 'Vikas', 100, 10000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (4, 'Rohit', 100, 5000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (5, 'Mudit', 200, 12000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (6, 'Agam', 200, 12000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (7, 'Sanjay', 200, 9000);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (8, 'Ashish', 200, 5000);

Using ROW_NUMBER()
The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within the result set, without considering ties.

Query:
SELECT *, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank, 
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_number 
FROM employee;


Using ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION:

QUERY:
SELECT *, 
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank, 
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_number 
FROM employee;
