QUESTION:-

mber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, 
total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

Note:

The tables may contain duplicate records.
The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. For example, 
if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.


CODE:-

SELECT 
c.company_code, c.founder,
COUNT(DISTINCT lm.lead_manager_code),
COUNT(DISTINCT sm.senior_manager_code),
COUNT(DISTINCT m.manager_code),
COUNT(DISTINCT e.employee_code)
FROM COMPANY c
INNER JOIN lead_manager lm ON lm.company_code = c.company_code
INNER JOIN Senior_manager sm ON sm.company_code = c.company_code
INNER JOIN Manager m ON m.company_code = c.company_code
INNER JOIN Employee e ON e.company_code = c.company_code
GROUP BY c.company_code,c.founder
ORDER BY c.company_code;
