 QUESTION:-

Generate the following two result sets:

1)Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical 
(i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
2)Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.


CODE:-

SELECT CONCAT(NAME,'(',LEFT(occupation),')')
FROM occupations
ORDER BY Name
SELECT CONCAT('There are a total of a',' ',COUNT(occupation),'s','.')
FROM occupations
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(occupation), occupation ASC;
