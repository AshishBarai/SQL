Exchange Seats

Question:-

Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
id is a continuous increment.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

Solution:-

Select 
	Case
	When id = (Select MAX(id) From Seat) And id % 2 = 1 Then id
	When id % 2 = 0 Then id - 1
	Else id + 1
	End AS id,
	Student
From Seat
Order By id ASC;
