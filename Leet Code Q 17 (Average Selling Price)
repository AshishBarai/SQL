LeetCode Q17/50 (Average Selling Price)

Question:-

Table: Prices

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write an SQL query to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

Code:-

SELECT t1.product_id,
        ROUND(SUM(t1.price * t2.units) / SUM(t2.units), 2) AS average_price
FROM prices AS t1
LEFT JOIN unitssold AS t2 ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
        AND t2.purchase_date BETWEEN t1.start_date AND t1.end_date
GROUP BY t1.product_id;
