Restaurant Growth

Question :-

Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

Solution :-

SELECT DISTINCT visited_on,
        SUM(amount) OVER(
            ORDER BY visited_on 
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) 
            AS amount,
        ROUND(SUM(amount) OVER(
            ORDER BY visited_on 
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 6 DAY PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) /7,2)
            AS average_amount
FROM Customer
ORDER BY visited_on ASC
LIMIT 1000000
OFFSET 6
