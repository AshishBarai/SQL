Qusetion:-

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.
Effective April 7th, 2023, the problem statement, solution and hints for this question have been revised.


Code:-

SELECT user_id,
        tweet_date, 
        ROUND(AVG(tweet_count) 
              OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date 
              ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),2) AS rolling_avg
FROM tweets
GROUP BY user_id,tweet_date,tweet_count;
