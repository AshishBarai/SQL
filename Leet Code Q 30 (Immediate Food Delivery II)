Immediate Food Delivery II

Question:-

Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Code:-


SELECT ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*)) * 100.00, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS first_orders
JOIN Delivery AS d ON first_orders.customer_id = d.customer_id AND first_orders.first_order_date = d.order_date;
